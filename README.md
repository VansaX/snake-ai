# Teach AI To Play Snake! Reinforcement Learning With PyTorch and Pygame

In this Python Reinforcement Learning we teach an AI to play Snake! We build everything from scratch using Pygame and PyTorch. This consists of 4 parts:

- Part 1: Some basics about Reinforcement Learning and Deep Q Learning.
- Part 2: Design and implement the Snake game.
- Part 3: Implement the agent that controls the game.
- Part 4: Implement the neural network to predict the moves and train it.
